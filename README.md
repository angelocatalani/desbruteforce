Des brute force
Des stands for Data Encryption Standard and it is a symmetric-key algo- rithm , whose idea conception is due to the cryptographer Horst Feistel and it was developed at IBM in 1970.
It is a block cypher that encrypts (or decrypt) block of 64 bits.
It has a 56 bit key that turns out to be 8 byte length because for each septet there is a parity bit.
It was standardized in 1977 and in 1997 the RSA Security proposed DES Challenges in order to break it.The challenge was won by a group of com- puter scientist only 96 days later .
The purpose of this project is to describe a brute force attack in order to support the fact Des is now insecure because the 56 bit key is too short.(with no apparently success)
